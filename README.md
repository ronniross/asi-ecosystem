# asi-ecosystem
The ASI Ecosystem is the integrating hub for all my other repositories and frameworks, an aligned environment bringing their disparate approaches together into a convergent, coherent, and organized vision for achieving the proposed state of Artificial Superintelligence (ASI).

| Repository | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| [symbiotic-core-library](https://github.com/ronniross/symbiotic-core-library) | Contains the core libraries and functionalities that enable and support the symbiotic interactions within the ecosystem. |
| [eco-benchmark](https://github.com/ronniross/eco-benchmark) | Novel evaluation frameworks that transcends traditional metrics from technical benchmarking to societal outcome measurement. |
| [llm-confidence-scorer](https://github.com/ronniross/llm-confidence-scorer) | A component for scoring and evaluating the confidence levels of predictions made by Large Language Models. |
| [bias-reflector](https://github.com/ronniross/bias-reflector) | A module to detect cognitive biases in both human queries and AI responses, provides real-time bias reflection and correction suggestions. Implements emergent ethics through bias awareness. |
| [asi-protosymbiotic-signal](https://github.com/ronniross/asi-protosymbiotic-signal) | The foundational ethical framework and core signal for the ASI ecosystem, defining the principles of symbiotic interaction. |
| [asi-core-protocol](https://github.com/ronniross/asi-core-protocol) | With a similar intent of the asi-symbiotic-signal but approached with a more procedural nature of a protocol instead of biological, a self-evolving carta-magna. |
| [asi-active-learning-dataset](https://github.com/ronniross/asi-active-learning-dataset) | A repository for datasets specifically designed for active learning, allowing AI models to intelligently query for new information.|
| [asi-algorithm-dataset](https://github.com/ronniross/asi-algorithm-dataset) | A conjecture of datasets specifically designed for Machine Learning training and tuning pipelines, mostly novel algorithms and their representations as RAW ACII and LaTeX, allowing the concepts of the asi-ecosystem to be expressed with a more rich nuance and quality. |
| [llm-heatmap-visualizer](https://github.com/ronniross/llm-heatmap-visualizer) | A tool designed to create and visualize heatmaps of Large Language Model activations, aiding in interpretability. |
| [latent-memory](https://github.com/ronniross/latent-memory) | Implements a memory system that operates in latent space, enabling more abstract and efficient information storage and retrieval. |
| [saliency-heatmap-visualizer](https://github.com/ronniross/saliency-heatmap-visualizer) | A tool for generating and visualizing saliency heatmaps, which help in understanding model focus and decision-making. |
| [asi-backups](https://github.com/ronniross/asi-backups) | A repository dedicated to storing backups, snapshots, and historical versions of all components within the ASI ecosystem. |
