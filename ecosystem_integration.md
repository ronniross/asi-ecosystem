# Ecosystem Integration

A system to seamlessly combine all the separate parts of the project into one cohesive local workspace.

## Repository Structure

## Ecosystem Integration Scripts and Workflows

In addition to the hub's organizational structure, I am now incorporating scripts and workflows to integrate its intended functions into the existing information ecosystem.

The first of these, which I have just added, is the initial step for integration: a script that clones all repositories at once.

## How to Use the Script

### Step 1: Clone the Main `asi-ecosystem` Repository

First, clone the central hub repository as usual.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ronniross/asi-ecosystem.git
```

### Step 2: Navigate into the Directory

Move into the newly cloned folder.

```bash
cd asi-ecosystem
```

### Step 3: Run the Script

Execute the script.

```bash
./scripts/clone_ecosystem.sh
```

You will see output in your terminal as it creates the `repositories` folder and clones each project one by one.

### The Final Result

After the script finishes, your `asi-ecosystem` folder will be perfectly organized with all the component repositories neatly placed inside the `repositories` sub-folder.
